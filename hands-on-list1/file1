The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief S Somanath has stated that the current
situation where NASA astronaut Sunita Williams is stuck in space for over 60 days 
will give lessons for future space missions like Gaganyaan. 
He told Hindustan Times that currently NASA is facing issues undocking Boeingâ€™s Starliner
from ISS.
This is something that can happen with Gaganyaan, an upcoming crewed ISRO mission.
India's ambitious human space mission, Gaganyaan, is taking a significant step forward
with the first test flight of its human-rated rocket scheduled for December 2024.
